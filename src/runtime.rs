//! UEFI uses the EFI Runtime Services Table, which contains a table header and pointers to all of the
//! runtime services. The definition for this table is shown in the following code fragments. Except for
//! the table header, all elements in the EFI Runtime Services Tables are prototypes of function
//! pointers to functions as defined in Section 8. Unlike the EFI Boot Services Table, this table, and the
//! function pointers it contains are valid after the UEFI OS loader and OS have taken control of the
//! platform with a call to EFI_BOOT_SERVICES.ExitBootServices(). If a call to SetVirtualAddressMap()
//! is made by the OS, then the function pointers in this table are fixed up
//! to point to the new virtually mapped entry points.
